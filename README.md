# Cypress PlayGround

====================

## Description

---------------

This is a Cypress Playground that I originally created to practice my Cypress skills. I've included a few e2e tests, some API tests, and some accessibility tests. This particular implementation uses Cucumber for the e2e tests so each test spec is split into a .feature and corresponding .js file.

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)

### Installation Steps

1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Valencia2019/cypress-playground.git
```

2. Install dependencies using npm

```bash
npm install
```

### Running the Tests

To open the Cypress GUI, run the following command:

```bash
npx cypress open
```

To run the tests in headless mode, run the following command:

```bash
npx cypress run
```
